Computer Networks and Systems professional with experience in FinTech industry.

I am passionate about creating lean, readable and bug-free software. I also like automating tedious, manual, often one-off tasks with shell or python scripts as much for my own satisfaction as for their re-usability, test-ability and accuracy. My experience in the IT product industry has given me an appreciation for an Agile test-driven development process with a focus on business requirements. I often find myself correcting my code in the subsequent iterations from strict-sanity checks to if-the-shoe-fits-the-horse... checks - mostly in industrial product pipelines where you want to get as much stuff out the door as possible so long it passes a certain minimum criteria.

I am a fast-learner and like a good mix of new challenges and old familiar to keep things interesting and sane. I can get tunnel-visioned at times, but I count that my strength as much my as weakness since it gives me unparalleled focus on the task at hand.
My education, skills, experience and accomplishments are detailed [here](/cv).

In my spare time I enjoy reading fiction; or hiking, trekking and camping when an urge for adventure takes hold of me. I love all things Tolkien and an occasional game of chess. I categorically dislike instant messaging (unless I need something or someone urgently which happens fairly often), social media (unless I need to find someone) and spam mail (because they hike up my unread mail count).
